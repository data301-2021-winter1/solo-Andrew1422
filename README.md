Andrew Kang: It is quite a common sense that any fire incidence should be treated as early as possible. However, in many cases due to varies reason a wildfire may not be discovered or treated at its earliest stage.  In my own prediction, if there are a massive number of fires happening in a relatively short period time, the fire department will be exhausted and overwhelmed, which will be unable to responds to some of the fire right away(after the fire was discovered). In the data set, this prediction should appear in the data set as when the number of fire in each month goes up, the average amount of area burned by each fire (number of fire/total area burned in the same month) would also goes up. If this prediction happen to be true, then it would means that the fire department need more crew, and the corresponding solution would be hire more crew in order to put down the fire quicker.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set shows how the area burnt and number of fires (for all Canadian provinces) vary due to different factors (fire cause, fire size, month)  from 1990 to 2020 and the corresponding property damage. The data set has been provided by the National Forestry Database (NFD), and it has been provided under the mandate of NFD which is to collect and compile national forest data and forest management statistics. The Canadian Forest Service (CFS) at Natural Resources Canada developed and maintains the NFD database. The CFS collects fire related data from various federal, provincial or territorial resource management organisations and then compiles it within the NFD database.
